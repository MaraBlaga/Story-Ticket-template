<h1 align="center">Story/Ticket template</h1>

You can use the *below* template when creating a new ticket. This will help you save time, when it comes to the information you need to include in your description, and also, this will help you make sure you don't forget any important requirements/questions/information.
<br><br>

>**Prerequisites**
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*In this section, you should add any links related to the ticket. e.g. links to dashboards, surveys, feed managers, schedulers etc.*
><br><br>**Background information**
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Use this section to give a brief description about the project/script/bug/etc. (here, you can point us to some old tickets where the functionality was implemented in the past, or some confluence pages where this was discussed, etc).*
><br><br>**Specification**
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Behaviour</u>
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Briefly specify how you envision the product should behave, once the development is done. (For complicated features, you could include a flow chart, if you think it helps to better explain the behaviour).*
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Design</u>
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Use this section to include anything that is related to the design of the feature (i.e. screenshots/prototypes/mockups/graphic
assets to explain the design, responsive design - what to expect when the window resizes, platforms used on - such as
tablets, mobile, desktops, etc.)*
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Questions</u>
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Use this section to include here any questions you might have at the moment of writing the ticket. This way, these questions
could be answered, and also, these questions might raise other concerns or clarifications.*
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Notes</u>
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Add here any points of confusion, or a list with assumptions, if necessary.*
>**Acceptance Criteria**
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <u>*Feature*</u> *: Title of requirement (short description of the requirement)*
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>*Scenario*</u>*: Given ______ and ______*
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*When _____* 
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Then _____*
><br>
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <u>Feature</u> *: Title of requirement (short description of the requirement)*
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>*Scenario*</u>: *Given ______ and ______*
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*When _____*
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Then _____*
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*etc.*
><br><br>**Metrics**
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Use this section to describe the impact that the change/functionality/bug would have, once it is resolved.*
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This part of the description should answer these questions: <ul><li>How many? (e.g. How many users do you expect to import?, How many users will use this piece of functionality?)</li><li>How often? (e.g. How often should this scheduler run?, How often should this page refresh?)</li><li>How fast/slow? (if relevant) (e.g. This script should not take longer than 3 hours, because another script depends on it, that runs after 2 hours)*</li></ul>
><br>**Non Functional Requirements**
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Here, you should include information about: usability, performance, accessibility, maintainability, reusability, etc.*
><br><br>**Reasons for urgency (if applicable)**
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Use this section to describe the reasons and the urgency behind this ticket. Try to be objective and clear.*

<br><br>

>**Prerequisites**
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*In this section, you should add any links related to the ticket. e.g. links to dashboards, surveys, feed managers, schedulers etc.*
><br><br>**Background information**
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Use this section to give a brief description about the project/script/bug/etc. (here, you can point us to some old tickets where the functionality was implemented in the past, or some confluence pages where this was discussed, etc).*
><br><br>**Steps to Reproduce**
><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Use this section to give the full details on how the specific problem can be replicated. It is very important to add screenshots, links, or
anything that can be useful to fully understand the behaviour. Using a numbered list could help understand the steps better and faster.* <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Also, if it's easier, a short video could replace this section. (a video that shows the steps needed to reproduce the problem). There are various tools that record your monitor (one of the simplest one would be PowerPoint).*
