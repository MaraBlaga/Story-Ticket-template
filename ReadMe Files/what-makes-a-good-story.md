<h1 align="center">What makes a good story/ticket?</h1>

### **Current problem**

As developers that work in an *[Agile environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)*, 
we rely and depend on tickets, in order to understand, document or prioritize a new system feature, a bug, a change request, etc.

It's really important to have some guidelines on how a ticket/user story should look like, 
or what information is best to include in the ticket, what types of documentation and information is expected
from you, when you're creating a new ticket, so that the whole team/company can get the same level
of understanding when looking at the ticket.

#### General things to bear in mind when creating a new ticket: ####
- The ticket will be edited by people with **different roles** within the company (developers, stakeholders, product managers, etc.),
so it's important to keep a consistent format.
- The ticket will be read by many people in this company, that are coming from **different domains
and fields**, with **different levels of experience and knowledge of the system**.
- The ticket will probably exist for **a long time**, and will be read in the future, 
so it's really important to document every event that happened related to that issue.
- We all forget. It's important to document **everything** related to the ticket, because, 
in the future, that can help us remember the reasons behind the implementation and the choices we made.
- Most likely nobody will read all of the comments from the ticket. Please try to include in the 
**description** of the ticket anything that was changed based on the conversations/comments. 
(The description of a ticket should always reflect the requirements agreed!)

#### What should be included in a ticket: ####

|  | Description | Reason why/ Observations |
|--|--|--|
|  1| **Title/Summary**| **This might be obvious, all tickets must have a title. The reason why it's included here is because the title is really important. It's the first thing everyone sees about that particular ticket. That's why it is super important that the title reflects the actual problem. A good title should be precise, clear, short, unambiguous.** <br> <br> *A few problems that a wrong title could cause:* <ul><li>People doing the **wrong thing** (People are very influenced by the title of the task, so they might end up building the wrong thing).</li><li>Lost time (Inconsistencies between the title and the description might lead to unnecessary **lost time**, trying to understand the real problem. Also, even searching for the ticket in JIRA (for example) might take longer time).</li><li>The ticket being **ignored or neglected** (when grooming the backlog, or when prioritizing, people might misunderstand the actual problem).</li></ul> <br> *Examples:*<ol> <li> Task Title: **\<action> \<activity>** e.g.: Research new javascript framework </li> <li> New Feature Title: **\<Implement/Create etc> \<product>** e.g.: Create ordering system </li><li> Improvement Title: **\<Improve/Update/Rename etc.> \<feature>** e.g.: Improve the performance of the analysis page </li><li> Bug Title: **\<system feature> is not/ does not/ should WHEN \<action>** e.g.: Place Order link does not work when accessed from the main page.</li></ol> |
|  2| **Priority**  | The next important thing you should always try to include in your tickets is the priority. When grooming the backlog and trying to prioritize the existing issues, one of the criteria that is used to sort and figure out the order of the tickets, is, you guessed it, the priority. <br> <br> *A few potential problems:* <ol> <li>**People tend to put their priority first** (It is very important to try to think about the other important tickets and clients that the company has, and try to objectively put a priority to your issue). </li><li>**High priority means the ticket will be solved first** (This is not a rule, and we should not add the highest priority to the tickets we create. It's important to bear in mind that the order of the tickets depends on multiple factors, such as: deadline, number of people available to take the issue, the type of the ticket - bug, feature, change request etc., how many users/people are influenced and directly affected by it, etc.)</li></ol> <br> *Examples:* <ol> <li>**Low** - Something that causes a minor impact.</li> <li> **Medium** - Something that causes a significant impact. </li><li> **High** - Something that is causing a problem and required immediate and urgent attention. </li> <li> **Highest** - This should be used when there is a big problem in the system, a bug that is affecting more clients, that stops you or the client on doing the normal activities. Normally, it's something that it's blocking general progress.</li> </ol> <br> *Observation:* Please bear in mind that the priority most often is something subjective, that can change over the life cycle of a ticket, based on different factors.|
|  3| **Related Issues** | One important information that you should provide is the linked issues. The related tickets can be: <br> **Old issues where it was done before:** Please always try and find a past issue where your request was done before. This is really helpful for any developer (and not only) that want to solve the issue, to just quickly go through the issue where this was past done, to read the requirements, to go through the code changes, maybe even read the comments! <br> **Related issues:** Most of the times is really useful if you could add the related issue(s) on the ticket (for example tickets that share the same context, same part of the system), because it might give us some more information that you maybe thought is not that relevant to the problems you're having. It's always better to give extra information, instead of it lacking. <br> **Blocks/is blocked by:** This piece of information is really valuable because it helps us understand the urgency or the status of the current issue. |
|  4| **Attachments** | **Screenshots:** Try to _always_ include screenshots describing the current problem (e.g.: certain page doesn't look as expected, a certain error message, etc.).<br> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; *Observation:* When it comes to a new addition of a text, image, box, etc. on a page, try to provide a snapshot of how you would imagine the final product would look like. It's easier for the developer to understand the change, if they can actually see it. It's also going to help with the confusion, with later changes, discussions, and testing, when it comes to delivering the final product. <br> <br> **Sample files:** Another important thing to keep in mind is sample files. In order for a developer to feel confident and comfortable with the change they made, it's very important to test those particular changes. But, in many cases, in order to test it, they need a sample file that would mimic the live behaviour. By having the file in the  ticket, they can properly test it and make sure the requirements are met and that the tests pass. Also, by having the file even before the actual work starts, they might have some questions, or they might have some consideration of how the change will be implemented, in order to fit with the current context. <br> <br> **Expected output files (if applicable):** Besides the sample files that developer (might) need in order to test the code, for that particular change, it's quite important to provide an output file, with the expected output. This way, they can test that the piece of code written for that specific ticket, is working based on the expected behaviour. <br><br> **Sketches/Drawings:** If you can't provide a screenshot of how you would envisage the change, please try to at least upload a photo/drawing/sketch. A photo could be much more useful than a huge description (_Remember: A picture is worth a thousand words!_ <br><br> :warning: When you are attaching a file/image/sketch, please try to <u>explain the context</u>  and <u>why that particular file is important</u>. Also, after you're explaining what it is for, please <u>specify its name in brackets</u> so the person who is reading it knows exactly which file you're talking about (When uploading many files/images on the same ticket, it can get quite confusing which is the one meant for testing, which one serves as a sample or example etc.). e.g. I am attaching a screenshot of how we would like the user interface for the landing page on this dashboard to look like (LandingPageDesign.PNG)|
|  5| **Description** | **Prerequisites** <br> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; In this section, you should add any links related to the ticket. e.g. links to different pages of the application, existing documentation, etc. <br> <br> **Background information** <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Use this section to give a brief description about the project/script/bug/etc. In this section you should explain the necessity of this piece of software, the reason behind it, and some background information that you think it will be useful to better understand the current situation. (here, you can point us to some old tickets where the functionality was implementated in the past, or some confluence pages where this was discussed, etc). <br> <br> **Requirements** <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; This part should respond to these questions: <ul> <li> What needs to be built? </li> <li> What do you expect it to do, once it's resolved? </li> <li>How do you envision it to work afterwards?</li> </ul>|
|  6| **Specification - behaviour, design, questions** |  In this section you should add more details about the requirements, and how it should look and behave, at the end. <br> <br> **Behaviour**<br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Specify how you envision the product should behave, once the development is done. (For complicated features, you could include a flow char, if you think it helpes to explain the behaviour better).<br> <br> **Design** <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; This section should respond to these question: <br> <ul> <li><span style="color:blue">What</span> should be shown? </li> <li> <span style="color:orange">Where</span> should it be shown? </li> <li><span style="color:red">How</span> should it be shown?</li> <br>Feel free to include here mockups, prototypes, graphic assets (images, links, etc.). Also, in this section (if applicable), you should include colours (hex codes), font sizes, other sizes (e.g.: paddings, margins, etc.). (:bulb: A graphic designer can help with this.) Another important thing that should be included here is the responsive design (i.e.: what to expect when the window resizes), accesibility, and the platforms used on (i.e. if the change should be supported on mobile, desktop, tablets). <br> <br> **Questions** <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; You should include here any questions you might have at the moment of writing the ticket. This way, these questions could be answered, and also, these questions might raise other concerns or clarifications.  <br> <br> **Notes (optional)** <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Add here any points of confusion, or a list with assumptions, if necessary. <br> <br> **Acceptance criteria** <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Even if you specified what you would expect from the ticket above (in the Requirements section), it's important to create some Use cases (Test cases). <br> <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; *Why is it important to have Use cases/Test cases?* <ol><li> By writing down the test cases that you expect to perfom once the ticket is resolved, you make the developers aware of the testing part, and how everything should behave, for that particular functionality, so that they can run those test before you, to make sure everything is working as specified.</li><li>By writing down the test cases that you expect to perfom once the ticket is resolved, you will have some time to think about the important areas that you want to test, and through this, you might discover some requirements, or some important steps that need to be specified.</li><li>In the future, once this ticket is resolved by the developer, you know exactly what you want to test, and how everything should behave.</li><li> When/If this issue is read by someone who is not familiar with the ticket/functionality, they will get a better and faster understanding of what it was expected in the first place.</li></ol> <br><br> Use Gherkin language to create your Test cases/Use cases. (:bulb: Gherkin is a business readable language, created especially for behaviour description).<br><br>*How should a Test case/Use case look like, using the Gherkin language?* ![](https://github.com/MaraBlaga/Story-Ticket-template/blob/master/Pictures/Gherkin.JPG)  <br> If that was not specific enough, here is an example:![](https://github.com/MaraBlaga/Story-Ticket-template/blob/master/Pictures/GherkinExample.JPG)  | 
|7|**Metrics**| Please use this part to describe the <u>impact</u> that the change/functionality/bug would have, once it is resolved. It is important to understand and to try to create a whole picture of the problem, so that we can think about all of the factors. <br> For example, this part of the description should answer these questions: <ul><li>How many? (e.g. How many users do you expect to import?, How many users will use this piece of functionality?)</li><li>How often? (e.g. How often should this scheduler run?, How often should this page refresh?)</li><li>How fast/slow? (if relevant) (e.g. This script should not take longer than 3 hours, because another script depends on it, that runs after 2 hours)</li></ul>|
|7|**Non-functional requirements**|Here, you should include information about: _usability, performance, accessibility, maintainability, reusability_. <br><br> By providing information about how you imagine this piece of functionality will work <u>in the future</u>, or how it's meant to be used, or how you would expect to work (even in an ideal world), we might be able to make some changes, from which the client(s) will benefit in the immediate future.|
|7|**Deadline**|Even if the actual date of the deadline is added in the End date field at the Epic level, please use this part here to describe the reasons and the urgency behind the ticket particular ticket (as the deadlines might differ). It is important for developer (but not only) to understand the reason behind the urgency, so we can prioritize later. Please try to be <u>objective</u> and clear.|

<h3 align="center"><b>Other small improvements for your ticket description:</b></h1>
<br>

|  | Improvement | Description/Examples |
|--|--|--|
|1|Try to keep the sentences short and try to use language that's clear to a wide audience.|As I said above, the ticket is mostly likely going to be read by *different people*, with *different positions* within the company. It's better to write a concise and easy to understand ticket.|
|2|Use text formatting tools, such as **Bold**, *Italic*, <u>Underline</u>, or different colours to raise attention on something you think is important.|This is probably self-explanatory, but it's important to show that *what* you think is relevant and important in a way that everyone will understand it.|
|3|The comments section is good for discussions, but it should **NEVER** contain requirements, notes, or anything that will change the initial description.|The description of a ticket should **always** reflect the requiremenets agreed! The comments section should be used only for claryfing requirements, updates, and small discussions. <br> **Important**: :warning: Still, IF the comments **CHANGE** any of these sections, take the time to improve the dscription of the ticket with the new requirements/changes.|
|4|Use the **Notes** and **Questions** section from the specification part of the description, to emphasize any confusions, assumptions.||
|5|Use bullet/numbered list(s).|Using a numbered list is a very effective in "forcing" you to write in a *short* and *unambiguous* style. Also, it is useful because you can later refer to a specfic functionality by its number.|
